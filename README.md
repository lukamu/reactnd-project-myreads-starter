# MyReads Project
# Author: Luca Musso

Starting from the templated provided, I create two new components: ListBooks and SearchBooks. The two componets are implemented in two new files, according with React best practices, named: ListBooks.js and SearchBooks.js.
This project is available on: 
https://github.com/lukamu/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`

## What You're Getting

    ├── ListBooks.js # This is the component that shows the books. It displays the shelfs when Route path is '/', otherwise the list of the available books according
    to the search query, when Route path is '/search'
    ├── SearchBooks.js # This is the component for searching new books. If a book is already in the list of my books, it shows the current shelf status. It contains an array with the list of the books that matched the query. When the user update the query, or the state of the book, the state is updated.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
